## Dataset

This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area. It has 1834412 observations and 16 features.


## Summary of Findings 

In the exploration, I found that the distribution of the number of trips looks to be log normal with the duration around a mean of 700sec. Also, most of the users are subscribers and males. On Thursday the largest number of trips is taken. I also found that most of the trips are taken at 8 and 17 o'clock. The distribution of the age is right skewed and there are many observations for users older than 100 years old. In the Bivariate Exploration I found that The average duration for customers is 1300 while for subscribers is about 600 and the Males tend to have the shortest trips on average while the users with gender 'other' have the longest trips. Even Though I found that the number of trips in the weekend is the shortest, the longest trips are taken on saturday and sunday. There is not a strong relation between the average duration and age but it looks like the average duration decreases with age untill 80 and increases a little bit again. In the Multivariate Exploration I did not discover a lot of new information, almost all trends behave the same way. But there seems to be a larger number of trips taken by older subscribed members and longer durations for subscribers younger than 60.


## Key Insights for Presentation a
In the presentation I focused on the distribution of the number of bikes with duration, user type, gender, start and end days of the trip, start and end hour of the trip and bikes used. I also looked at the distribution of the age, start stations and bike shared for each trip. 

Then the bivariate part I plotted a heat map of the correlation betwen numeric variables, and a plot matrix. I investigated the dependence of average duration on the user type, gender, start day, start hour, start station, and finally age.

Lastly in the multivariate part I investigated the effect of a couple of combination of variables on the average duration of trips.
