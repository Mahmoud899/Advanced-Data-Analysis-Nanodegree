This Nanodegree includes three projects:

1- Investigate a Dataset
In this project I did a thorough analysis on a given dataset, dataset of the patiens in a brazelian hospital, using python.   

2- A/B Testing
In this project I applied the concepts of Statistics to run a Hypothesis Test on the data and draw some insightful conclusions.     

3- Data Visualization    
In this project I conducted Exploraory and Explanatory Data Analysis on the dataset and used some compelling visualizations in the analysis using python packages like    matplotlib and seaborn. Finally I summarized the results in a presentations using the insightful visualizations.
